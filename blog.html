                This post is written for a Web Design Decal extra topic lecture and shows the
                steps of deploying a static website using GitHub Pages. If you
                already have experience with Git/GitHub, I suggest reading the extremely
                succinct explanation on the website of GitHub Pages. This post will start
                from the very beginning.

                The time has come once again for UC Berkeley's student government elections,
                and this season revives many of my feelings of frustration, helplessness, regret,
                and disillusionment. When I read the campaign platforms of the next cycle of
                student representatives, I see trite phrases and empty promises. I do not see
                fire. I do not see purpose. I do not see passion. I do not see great big dreams.
                And this scares me. This angers me. This depresses me. So I write. I write
                about what I would change if I could. I write to rant. I write to start a
                conversation. I write with the hope that perhaps someone less disillusioned
                can be motivated by my words.

                This post was largely motivated by Libby Rainey's Daily Californian article
                entitled "Breeding the Tech Elite." I have often had discussions with my
                fellow CS friends about the growing importance of technology, and a question
                we often ask ourselves is, "What can we as engineers do with our skills
                and knowledge to better society?"

                A week or so ago I realized that it's been about a year since I started in
                computer science. Looking back, I am thankful for what I've learned, where
                I've come, and the world I've found. And I am so grateful to those who have
                helped me along the way. I thought I would make this introspective post to
                remind myself of this first year of CS.

                This is a guide to version control by a beginner for beginners. I first
                heard the words "version control" from my friend Soumya Basu a little
                less than a year ago. He had taken one look at my previous way of saving
                versions of my CS project and had just started laughing. I was a bit
                taken aback at first, then incredulous when he said there already
                existed systems to do what I had been doing. Now looking back, I am so
                thankful that he told me about version control when he did.

                Some Americans declare that Edward Snowden is "grandiose narcissist who
                deserves to be in prison." They state that Snowden's leaks did not
                demonstrate true violations but rather only exposed government policies
                that "failed to meet his own standards of propriety." I disagree with
                this view. Snowden is a whistleblower who did not simply dump information
                to hurt the United States, but rather revealed government abuses in such
                a way that the public is now able to propose changes and reviews that
                will lead to future transparency, morality, and reform.
